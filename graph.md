Let $$M$$ be a (real and smooth) manifold. We define an infinite-dimensional vector space over $$\mathbb R$$ with the underlying set of all smooth functions $$\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$$

$$\mathcal{C}^\infty(M) := \{f: M \to \mathbb R \mid f\text{ is smooth}\} $$

and with point-wise defined operations, (i.e. for any $$p\in M$$, and any $$\lambda \in \mathbb R$$):
