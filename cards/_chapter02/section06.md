## Co-Vectors

The ecosystem containing curves, and smooth functions on a manifold is a particularly fruitful one. A lot of animals evolved around it. 

We have already seen the animal that has a specific curve at a specific point, and when you feed it a continuous function it will give you a real number - the tangent vector.

Now letâ€™s look at the animal that has a specific continuous function and lives at a specific point. When you feed it a tangent vector (the animal that has a curve through that point) it will give you a real number. This species is called a co-vector. It uses the same inner organ - the differential structure - to digest the input to a real number. So it is very similar to a tangent vector but we make a distinction by their function, because the two species take different inputs to produce the same output. 
The one animal has a curve built-in and takes a function as input, the other one has a function built-in and eats a tangent vector.
